Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.", "We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal we've established for ourselves. It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile.", "I love a man with a great sense of humor and who is intelligent - a man who has a great smile. He has to make me laugh. I like a man who is very ambitious and driven and who has a good heart and makes me feel safe.

These are always my goals and my attitude.', "It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure.", "I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.", 'Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.', 'Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make a negative decision in the low time.

We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.", 'Mental prayer in my opinion is nothing else than an intimate sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with Him who we know loves us.

Now, my goals are to see my grandchildren grown, live a long and healthy life with my family and friends and travel the world.', "It's so important to realize that every time you get upset, it drains your emotional energy. Losing your cool makes you tired. Getting angry a lot messes with your health.", 'Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.

It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.", "I am astonished each time I come to the U.S. by the ignorance of a high percentage of the population, which knows almost nothing about Latin America or about the world. It's quite blind and deaf to anything that may happen outside the frontiers of the U.S.", "You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past.

You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.", 'Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.', "It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life.

In those early days, I developed the skills that gave me a certain degree of success in American politics.', "As I get older, my perspective changes, and I just see how relationships aren't always what they appear to be. It's one of those sad but true things. We can see sometimes when people are becoming distant in all the things that create breaking apart, as painful as it is, and at the same time, still appreciating that person.", "We often say that the M&M Group's destiny is inextricably linked with India's.

I want them to see it whether they want to or not.", "It's been a long comeback. Things were pretty dark for me. But I have a faith now, and it saves my day.

In the end, I got sick and tired of being sick and tired.", 'I love spending time with my friends and family. The simplest things in life give me the most pleasure: cooking a good meal, enjoying my friends.', "The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.", "You can't jump from little things to big things. It just takes time and patience.", 'Spending time with negative people can be the fastest way to ruin a good mood.

They have their own problems!", "The credit of my good upbringing goes to my mother, who's not only been a single parent to my brother and I, but she's also been 'our' manager for the longest time.

We could be gone tomorrow. Any minute could truly be our goodbye. But we do have this moment. This time. Today. Right now.
