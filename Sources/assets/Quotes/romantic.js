const romantic=["You cannot look up at the night sky on the Planet Earth and not wonder what it's like to be up there amongst the stars. And I always look up at the moon and see it as the single most romantic place within the cosmos.", 'Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.', 'Romance is tempestuous. Love is calm.', 'The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes - or just by staring into space.', "The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.", "The thing is that love gives us a ringside seat on somebody else's flaws, so of course you're gonna spot some things that kinda need to be mentioned. But often the romantic view is to say, 'If you loved me, you wouldn't criticise me.' Actually, true love is often about trying to teach someone how to be the best version of themselves.", "We invest less in our friendships and expect more of friends than any other relationship.

You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase.", 'If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.', 'Breathless, we flung us on a windy hill, Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.', 'A beautiful woman delights the eye; a wise woman, the understanding; a pure one, the soul.', 'All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.', 'A romantic date for me is sitting in pajamas and being with a guy with whom I can be myself.', 'I am a romantic, and I think dates are wonderful. I like quirky and fun things. Like going for a bike ride or for a pedicure together.', 'Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter.', "Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not.'", 'When most people set out to change their lives, they often focus on all the external stuff, like a new job or a new location or new friends or a new romantic prospects and on and on. The reality is that changing your life starts with changing the way you see everything in your life.', 'What is love? It is the morning and the evening star.', "The romantic love we feel toward the opposite sex is probably one extra help from God to bring you together, but that's it. All the rest of it, the true love, is the test.", 'Come live with me and be my love, And we will all the pleasures prove, That valleys, groves, hills, and fields, Woods, or steepy mountain yields.', "There's nothing more romantic than Italian food.", "I'm not very romantic.

It's an incredibly romantic and beautiful place.", 'Those fields of daisies we landed on, and dusty fields and desert stretches. Memories of many skies and earths beneath us - many days, many nights of stars.', 'Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew, Whose short refresh upon tender green, Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth show And straight is gone, as it had never been.', "'Little Night' has layers of meaning. There's something enchanted about night. All those heavenly bodies, shooting stars, the crescent moon, celestial phenomenon. Owls fly at night, and first kisses happen. Night is romantic. Alternately, darkness hides the worst of human behavior.", 'True love stories never have endings.', 'A tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure.', "If you don't love me, it does not matter, anyway I can love for both of us.", 'The sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a great deal longer.', "A lot of times, in our culture and our society, we put romantic love somehow on a higher plane than self-love and friendship love. You can't do that. You have to honor and really fully invest in all these different loving relationships.", "I'm not done with love, but I refuse to settle. I am a hopeless romantic. And I won't stop till I get it right.", 'Morning without you is a dwindled dawn.', 'Long walks on the beach are the supposed holy grail of a romantic evening. The beach becomes a kind of utopia - the place where all our dreams come true.', 'I am in you and you in me, mutual in divine love.', 'I was meant to date the captain of the football team, I was going to be on a romantic excursion every Saturday night, I was destined to be collecting corsages from every boy in town before prom, accepting such floral offerings like competing sacrifices to a Delphic goddess.', "I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart's affections, and the truth of imagination.", 'Havana, for all its smells, sweat, crumbling walls, isolation, and difficult history, is the most romantic city in the world.', "I love the ukulele.

I live in the suburbs, the final battleground of the American dream, where people get married and have kids and try to scratch out a happy life for themselves. It's very romantic in that way, but a bit naive. I like to play with that in my work.", "I'm a very loyal boyfriend. I'm a bit of a joker...

It's made me a better person, to keep a good spirit about dating.", "People who know me, they know I have a sense of humor, I'm a bit of a joker, a bit of a clown really, and I would love someone to exploit that side of me and send me a romantic comedy."]
