const sad=["Some days are just bad days, that's all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is!", 'Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.', "You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens.", 'I am closest to my mother, as she is my rock, my pillar of strength, and my world.

You don't stay happy forever. You don't stay sad forever.", 'Heavy hearts, like heavy clouds in the sky, are best relieved by the letting of a little water.', 'For me, singing sad songs often has a way of healing a situation. It gets the hurt out in the open into the light, out of the darkness.', 'Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.', "Grief is never something you get over. You don't wake up one morning and say, 'I've conquered that; now I'm moving on.' It's something that walks beside you every day. And if you can learn how to manage it and honour the person that you miss, you can take something that is incredibly sad and have some form of positivity.", "It's okay to be sad if things don't go the way you had hoped.", "It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure.", 'When you wake up each morning, you can choose to be happy or choose to be sad.

Tomorrow morning, when the sun shines through your window, choose to make it a happy day.', "I'm not a sad person, upset the whole time, but I seem to be quite emotional.", "Everything takes me longer than I expect. It's the sad truth about life.", "People who have never dealt with depression think it's just being sad or being in a bad mood. That's not what depression is for me; it's falling into a state of grayness and numbness.", 'There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.', "How do I control my emotions? How do I stop getting angry so often, or how do I stop being sad? And I think there's a really important distinction to understand is that you can't completely control your emotions. What you control is your reaction to your own emotions. And a lot of people don't ever make that separation for what goes on with them.", 'There are so many things in life that make you sad, you have to be happy.', 'Oh, I am very weary, Though tears no longer flow; My eyes are tired of weeping, My heart is sick of woe.', "We can feel sad, hurt, demoralized.

I'm fine with that.", "Tears are nature's lotion for the eyes. The eyes see better for being washed by them.", 'I seldom think about my limitations, and they never make me sad.

You laugh when you're the most upset.", 'There are times I am happy. There are times I am sad. But I always try to separate emotion from the need to reach for something stronger, deeper. And then no matter the emotion, I can reach for a stability that helps me accomplish what is the goal.', "As I get older, my perspective changes, and I just see how relationships aren't always what they appear to be. It's one of those sad but true things. We can see sometimes when people are becoming distant in all the things that create breaking apart, as painful as it is, and at the same time, still appreciating that person.", "Every human walks around with a certain kind of sadness. They may not wear it on their sleeves, but it's there if you look deep.", 'The good times of today, are the sad thoughts of tomorrow.', "When you feel sad, it's okay. It's not the end of the world.

I just write to feel better.", "The sad truth is that opportunity doesn't knock twice.", "I don't like people around me sad. I like making people happy.", "There is still so much drama in my life, but I'm not a sad person anymore.", 'I have a piece of great and sad news to tell you: I am dead.', 'A teardrop on earth summons the King of heaven.', 'You left and I cried tears of blood.

Now, how will I cry?', 'Never make a decision when you are upset, sad, jealous or in love.', "Feeling sad or lonely isn't a bad thing. But those emotions increase the risk that you'll cross the line into self-pity.", 'The tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives - the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself.', "There's so much to argue about. That was the goal with 'Really Really.' Somebody asked me once, 'How should I feel when I leave?' and I said, 'Hopefully, you're talkative.' I don't really care if you're happy or sad or loved it or hated it or hate me. The goal is that you have something to say, that you have a response.", "Being sad and being depressed are two different things. Also, people going through depression don't look so, while someone sad will look sad. The most common reaction is, 'How can you be depressed? You have everything going for you. You are the supposed number one heroine and have a plush home, car, movies... What else do you want?'", "Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth.

You can't; no one can.", "That's what is so great about being able to record a 13-song album. You can do a very eclectic group of songs. You do have some almost pop songs in there, but you do have your traditional country, story songs.

From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.', "It's sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.", "Ten years ago, I still feared loss enough to abandon myself in order to keep things stable. I'd smile when I was sad, pretend to like people who appalled me. What I now know is that losses aren't cataclysmic if they teach the heart and soul their natural cycle of breaking and healing.", "I wanted to write a book that talked about the emotions of children, which is the rainbow.
