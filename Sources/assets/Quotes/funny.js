You can teach timing, or some people are able to tell a joke, though I don't like to tell jokes. But I think you have to be born with a sense of humor and a sense of timing.", "Most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody else's expense.

Enjoy it. Calm down. It's all funny. Next. Everyone gets so upset about the wrong things.", "The funny thing is that my husband couldn't be sweeter. He looks like this bad boy. He's got tattoos and earrings and a mohawk, but when you talk to him and he's around you, he's such a gentleman. He holds doors for ladies. He pulls out chairs. He cooks.
