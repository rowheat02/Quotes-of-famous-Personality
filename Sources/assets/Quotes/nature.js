const nature=['I have seen many storms in my life. Most storms have caught me by surprise, so I had to learn very quickly to look further and understand that I am not capable of controlling the weather, to exercise the art of patience and to respect the fury of nature.', 'Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.', 'My wish is to stay always like this, living quietly in a corner of nature.', 'In nature, light creates the color. In the picture, color creates the light.', 'There are moments when all anxiety and stated toil are becalmed in the infinite leisure and repose of nature.', 'Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine.', 'Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.', 'Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.', 'We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls.', 'One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.', 'If the sight of the blue skies fills you with joy, if a blade of grass springing up in the fields has power to move you, if the simple things of nature have a message that you understand, rejoice, for your soul is alive.', 'Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby.', "In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful.", "Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean.", 'All things are artificial, for nature is the art of God.', 'Nature is the one song of praise that never stops singing.', "Beauty is grace and confidence. I've learned to accept and appreciate what nature gave me.", 'Earth and sky, woods and fields, lakes and rivers, the mountain and the sea, are excellent schoolmasters, and teach some of us more than we can ever learn from books.', 'The rain began again. It fell heavily, easily, with no meaning or intention but the fulfilment of its own nature, which was to fall and fall.', 'Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.', 'Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.', "Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.", 'Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.', 'There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more.', 'Nature is so powerful, so strong. Capturing its essence is not easy - your work becomes a dance with light and the weather. It takes you to a place within yourself.', 'In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous.', 'Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you.', 'No better way is there to learn to love Nature than to understand Art. It dignifies every flower of the field. And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary stone.', 'It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.', 'That the sea is one of the most beautiful and magnificent sights in Nature, all admit.', "The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.", 'The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be.', 'All my life through, the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child.', "So many times, people told me I can't do this or can't do that. My nature is that I don't listen very well. I'm very determined, and I believe in myself. My parents brought me up that way. Thank God for that. I don't let anything stand in my way.", 'In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.', 'The sky is the part of creation in which nature has done for the sake of pleasing man.', 'The three great elemental sounds in nature are the sound of rain, the sound of wind in a primeval wood, and the sound of outer ocean on a beach.', 'The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.', 'Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul.', 'Green is the prime color of the world, and that from which its loveliness arises.', 'Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.', "You and I are, by birth, by nature, and by choice, inwardly depraved, which is to say that we are entirely corrupt. That's not to say that we have no good in us; we do. However, anything good in us has been tainted with evil. It touches everything. Without the redeeming power of Christ we cannot halt our own moral slide.", 'The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.', 'I have lived pain, and my life can tell: I only deepen the wound of the world when I neglect to give thanks the heavy perfume of wild roses in early July and the song of crickets on summer humid nights and the rivers that run and the stars that rise and the rain that falls and all the good things that a good God gives.', 'For in the true nature of things, if we rightly consider, every green tree is far more glorious than if it were made of gold and silver.', 'The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just on the body, but the soul.', 'Being alone on the moors is scary; as the rain clouds settle in, it makes you realise your place in nature.', "The key to nature's therapy is feeling like a tiny part of it, not a master over it. There's amazing pride in seeing a bee land on a flower you planted - but that's not your act of creation, it's your act of joining in.", "And out of darkness came the hands that reach thro' nature, moulding men.", 'The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep.', 'One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living.

The eyes see better for being washed by them.", "I'm continually inspired by nature, and the rainbow is one of nature's greatest optical phenomenons. The sighting of a rainbow never fails to bring a smile to people's faces. They signify optimism and positivity: with them comes the sunshine after the rain.", 'The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity... and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.', "Do activities you're passionate about - which make your heart and soul feel perky - including things like working out, cooking, painting, writing, yoga, hiking, walking, swimming, being in nature, being around art, or reading inspiring books.", "It's really important to have balance, spend some time in nature, go to a few parties, enjoy my friends and really chill out.", "Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude.", 'Every particular in nature, a leaf, a drop, a crystal, a moment of time is related to the whole, and partakes of the perfection of the whole.', 'Never measure the height of a mountain until you have reached the top.

Develop the divinity that is within you.', 'Nature is ever at work building and pulling down, creating and destroying, keeping everything whirling and flowing, allowing no rest but in rhythmical motion, chasing everything in endless song out of one beautiful form into another.', 'One of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between Man and Nature shall not be broken.', 'The day of the sun is like the day of a king.

It's geometrically perfect. It's tiny and gigantic. You can travel far to be in a beautiful natural setting, or you can observe it in your backyard - or, in my case, in the trees lining New York City sidewalks, or in the clouds above skyscrapers.", "The rainbow is a part of nature, and you have to be in the right place to see it. It's beautiful, all of the colors, even the colors you can't see. That really fit us as a people because we are all of the colors. Our sexuality is all of the colors. We are all the genders, races, and ages.", 'Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature.', "Nature doesn't need people - people need nature; nature would survive the extinction of the human being and go on just fine, but human culture, human beings, cannot survive without nature.", 'Truth is by nature self-evident.

When I see a beautiful sunset, I worship the god of Nature; when I see a hidden action brought to light, I worship the god of Truth; when I see a bad man punished and a good man go free, I worship the god of Justice; when I see a penitent forgiven, I worship the god of Mercy.', 'Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.', 'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.', "Another thing I like to do is sit back and take in nature.

Wishing you the best on your trek towards your dreams.', "Mother Nature is the great equalizer. You can't get away from it.", "Truth is, I'll never know all there is to know about you just as you will never know all there is to know about me.
