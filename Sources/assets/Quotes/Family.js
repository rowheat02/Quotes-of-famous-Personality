Till then, it's normal to have a partner and do your own thing.", "I do have a close circle of friends and I am very fortunate to have them as friends.

People have challenges. Family members get sick, people get older, you don't always get the job or the promotion that you want. You have conflicts in your life.

He's a family man, and he's always giving back to God. That is what makes him a beautiful man. We're not perfect by any means, but that makes us beautiful as well. We're not afraid to say we're not perfect. We have our disagreements, but that comes along with marriage.", "We are not a typical family that goes for a movie on Sunday or has dinner together every night.

Luckily, I have my dad, mom and sister.', "Family is a unique gift that needs to be appreciated and treasured, even when they're driving you crazy.

When there was school, it was under a tree. Then the United Nations came. They fed me, my family, my community.', "I think it's difficult to say what exactly made me become a successful DJ. It depends on so many different things. If I were given an award, I would thank my family, friends, Tiesto and the great team behind me for all their support and hard work. Without them, I wouldn't be where I am today.", 'Almost every time we get together with family or friends, the conversation ends up being about food.', "I have lots of friends, but I'm probably a terrible friend to all of them, even my family.
