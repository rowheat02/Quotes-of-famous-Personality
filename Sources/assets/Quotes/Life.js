const life=["Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.", 'Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.', "Learn to enjoy every minute of your life.

God loves you! He wants you to live with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today!', 'Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.', 'Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight.

It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth.', 'Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you need no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.', 'Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure.

As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.", 'A real man loves his wife, and places his family as the most important thing in life. Nothing has brought me more peace and content in life than simply being a good husband and father.', "I believe that a trusting attitude and a patient attitude go hand in hand. You see, when you let go and learn to trust God, it releases joy in your life. And when you trust God, you're able to be more patient. Patience is not just about waiting for something... it's about how you wait, or your attitude while waiting.", "Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.", 'Whatever you do, do with determination. You have one life to live; do your work with passion and give your best. Whether you want to be a chef, doctor, actor, or a mother, be passionate to get the best result.', 'Never stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard, and have perseverance to realise the great life.', "You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens.", "Money doesn't mean anything to me.

People have challenges. Family members get sick, people get older, you don't always get the job or the promotion that you want. You have conflicts in your life.

Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.', "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.", "Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you'll start to see a big difference in your life.", 'Take up one idea.
